## Contribute

### Add a new grammar

1. Fork this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`.
3. Add grammar source and metadata to [`sources-grammars.ts`](./sources-grammars.ts).
4. Add a code sample file `<id>.sample` for your language under [`./samples`](./samples). A sample should include a variety of language syntaxes and succinctly capture the idiosyncrasy of a language. Format requirements:
  - Space for indentation.
  - Less than 100 columns if possible.
  - A comment with a link to the source on the last line (e.g. `# From https://poignant.guide/book/chapter-5.html`).
5. Generate a [personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens?type=beta) with the default permissions. This token is used to query public information from GitHub API and avoid rate limits.
6. Create a `.env` file and paste your generated token into the file like so:
```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-personal-access-token
```
7. Run `pnpm run fetch` to download the grammar.
8. Run `pnpm run play` to start the playground. Select the new grammar in the left column to verify the accuracy and confirm that the grammar works as expected.
9. Send in the PR!
